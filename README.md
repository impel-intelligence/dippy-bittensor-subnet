## Introduction

> **Note:** The following documentation assumes you are familiar with basic Bittensor concepts: Miners, Validators, and incentives. If you need a primer, please check out https://docs.bittensor.com/learn/bittensor-building-blocks.

Dippy is one of the world's leading AI companion apps with **1M+ users**. The app has ranked [**#3 on the App Store**](https://x.com/angad_ai/status/1850924240742031526) in countries like Germany, been covered by publications like [**Wired magazine**](https://www.wired.com/story/dippy-ai-girlfriend-boyfriend-reasoning/) and the average Dippy user **spends 1+ hour on the app.** 

The Dippy Roleplay subnet on Bittensor aims to create the world's best open-source roleplay LLM by leveraging the collective efforts of the open-source community. This subnet addresses the critical issue of loneliness, which affects a significant portion of the population and is linked to various mental and physical health problems. 

Current SOTA LLMs (Claude, OpenAI etc.) are designed for the assistant use case and lack the empathetic qualities necessary for companionship. While some companies (like Character AI and Inflection) have developed closed-source roleplay LLMs, the open-source alternatives lag significantly behind in performance.

## Roadmap

Given the complexity of creating a state of the art roleplay LLM, we plan to divide the process into 3 distinct phases.

**Phase 1:** 
- [x] Subnet launch with robust pipeline for roleplay LLM evaluation on public datasets and response length 
- [x] Public model leaderboard based on evaluation criteria
- [x] Introduce Coherence and Creativity as a criteria for live model evaluation

**Phase 2:** 
- [ ] Publicly release front-end powered by top miner submitted model of the week
- [ ] Segment model submission into different "expert" categories (funny, romantic, therapeutic etc)
- [ ] Models with the highest score in each personality type are chosen as "expert" models and made publicly available on the front-end

**Phase 3:** 
- [ ] New Mixture of Experts model made as a baseline based on the "expert" models chosen from Phase 2
- [ ] Robust pipeline to evaluate new MOE model submissions against live evaluation criteria
- [ ] Expand the state of the art in roleplay LLMs through continuous iteration and data collection

## Overview of Miner and Validator Functionality

![overview](/assests/architecturenew.png)

**Miners** would use existing frameworks, fine tuning techniques, or MergeKit, to train, fine tune, or merge models to create a unique roleplay LLM. These models would be submitted to a shared Hugging Face pool. 

**Validators** would evaluate the and assess model performance via our protocol and rank the submissions based on various metrics (empathy, conciseness etc). We will provide a suite of 
testing and benchmarking protocols with state-of-the-art datasets.



## Running Miners and Validators
### Running a Miner

#### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- GPU with at least 24 GB of VRAM

#### Setup
To start, clone the repository and `cd` to it:
```
git clone https://github.com/impel-intelligence/dippy-bittensor-subnet.git
cd dippy-bittensor-subnet
pip install -e .
```
#### Submitting a model
As a miner, you're responsible for leveraging all methods available at your disposal, including but not limited to training new models, merging existing models (we recommend [MergeKit](https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit)), finetuning existing models, and so on to push roleplay LLMs forward.

We outline the following criteria for Phase 1:

- Models should be 7B-13B parameters. Current maximum model size is 32GB. 
- We don't support quantized models at the moment...coming soon!
- Models MUST be Safetensors Format! Check upload_models.py for how the model upload precheck works.
- Please test the model by loading model using transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained
- (Recommended) Test the model with arbitrary inputs, before submitting, to check for NaNs.
- Models we are confident will work are of the Mistral-7B and Llama-3 8B family.
- We support the "alpaca", "chatml", "llama2", "llama3", "mistral", "vicuna" and "zephyr" chat templates.

Once you're happy with the performance of the model for the usecase of Roleplay, you can simply submit it to Hugging Face ðŸ¤— and then use the following command:

```bash
python3 dippy_subnet/upload_model.py --hf_repo_id HF_REPO --wallet.name WALLET  --wallet.hotkey HOTKEY --chat_template MODEL_CHAT_TEMPLATE --model_dir PATH_TO_MODEL   
```


### Running a Validator

#### Requirements
- Python 3.9+

#### Setup
To start, clone the repository and `cd` to it:
```
git clone https://github.com/impel-intelligence/dippy-bittensor-subnet.git
cd dippy-bittensor-subnet
pip install -e .
```
To run the evaluation, simply use the following command:

``` 
python neurons/validator.py --wallet.name WALLET_NAME --wallet.hotkey WALLET_HOT_NAME
```

To run auto-updating validator with PM2 (recommended):
```bash
pm2 start --name sn11-vali-updater --interpreter python scripts/start_validator.py -- --pm2_name sn11-vali --wallet.name WALLET_NAME --wallet.hotkey WALLET_HOT_NAME [other vali flags]
```

Please note that this validator will call the model validation service hosted by the dippy subnet owners. If you wish to run the model validation service locally, please follow the instructions below.


### Running the model evaluation API (Optional)

**Note**: Currently (June 17 2024) there are some issues with the local evaluation api. We recommend using the remote validation api temporarily.

Starting a validator using your local validator API requires starting validator with `--use-local-validation-api` flag. 
Additionally, a model queue is required to push models to the validation api.

**Note**: Validator API needs to be installed in a different venv than validator due to `pydantic` version conflict. 


### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Linux

#### Setup

Install Git Lfs if not installed.
```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

If you are running on runpod you might also need to install 'netstat'.
```bash
apt-get install net-tools
```

To start, clone the repository and `cd` into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/impel-intelligence/dippy-bittensor-subnet.git
cd dippy-bittensor-subnet
python3 -m venv model_validation_venv
source model_validation_venv/bin/activate
model_validation_venv/bin/pip install -e . --no-deps
model_validation_venv/bin/pip install -r requirements_val_api.txt
```

#### Run model validation API service (optional)
(Note: there are currently breaking changes that pose challenges to running a local validation API service. Any tasks that require the env vars `ADMIN_KEY` or `DIPPY_KEY` applies here)
```bash
cd dippy_validation_api
chmod +x start_validation_service.sh
./start_validation_service.sh
```

### Test that it's working
```bash
python3 test_api.py
```
And you should see a json showing that the model status is "QUEUED"
Running the same command again for sanity's sake, you should see the status of the model as "RUNNING".


#### Stop model validation API service
```bash
chmod +x kill_validation_api.sh
./kill_validation_api.sh
```

#### Running the validator with your own validation API service running locally (optional)
```bash
# Make a separate venv for the validator because of pydantic version conflict
python -m venv validator_venv
validator_venv/bin/pip install -e .
validator_venv/bin/python neurons/validator.py --wallet.name WALLET_NAME --wallet.hotkey WALLET_HOT_NAME --use-local-validation-api
# Run model queue to push models to validation api to be evaluated
validator_venv/bin/python neurons/model_queue.py --use-local-validation-api
```
## Model Evaluation Criteria
### Model Size
A smaller model will score higher than a big model. Model size is the disk space occupied by the model repo from HF. The max model size is limited to 72GB.

<!-- $S_{size} = 1 - ModelSize/ MaxModelSize$ -->
### Latency
A faster model will score higher than a slow model.

### Output Similarity
Evaluated against datasets, a model that generates similiar resposne to groundtruth will score higher.

### Vibe Matching
A model that can generate outputs with similiar length to its inputs will score higher.
